# Dynatrace timetracking via Excel spreadsheet

From 2019-04-01 on you'll have to use two things:
- my [Excel spreadsheet v16+](./spreadsheet/spreadsheet.xlsx) to track your working times
- my bookrmarklet to book your times from the spreadsheet to Timecockpit

## How to

1) drag this [bookmarklet](javascript:alert('hello');) to your bookmarks bar (or add the link to your bookmarks)

2) click the bookmarklet to use it (will forward to Timecockpit if not open yet)

3) copy strings from spreadsheet and paste them into the bookmarklet's window

4) click BOOK
